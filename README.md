### Hi, I'm Joe!

I'm the Principal Systems Architect at [DEV](https://dev.to/about). I'm a Fedora Linux user and am passionate about enabling others to improve their lives with Open Source Software.

Some Fun Facts about me:
- I'm a college sports fan, especially so of my alma mater [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/)
- I enjoy video games in my spare time.
- I have the strength of a bear that has the strength of _two_ bears
